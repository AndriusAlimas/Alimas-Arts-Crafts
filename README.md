In this project, I build a simple website for a fictional arts and crafts store 

## Technologies:
 * **HTML**
 * **CSS**

## Project Guidelines

`In this project, youâ€™ll build a simple website for a fictional arts and crafts store using the tools on your own computer. You should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.`

At a high-level, this project will require the following:

1. **A folder structure that makes sense for the project**
2. **An HTML file**
3. **A CSS file**
